          <h4>Street food</h4>
          <p>
            Hanoi’s street food ranges from a collection of slightly grotty
            roadside tables and low stools to nicer looking eateries with
            bathrooms. Most of the time, you grab any available seat and then
            order what you want to eat
          </p>

        <div class="activity puppet">

          <h4>Water pupet</h4>
          <p>
            The art form of water puppetry originated at least 1,000 years ago
            in the rice fields of north Vietnam. Particularly if you’re
            traveling with kids, you’d be remiss to leave Hanoi without catching
            a show at the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="activity opera">
          <img src="images/opera.jpg" />
          <h4>Opera house</h4>
          <p>
            French colonists in Vietnam wanted to enjoy the same leisure time
            activities in Asia that they had loved in France. This is a smaller
            version of the famous Opera House in Paris, built between 1857-74
            and designed by Charles Garnier.
