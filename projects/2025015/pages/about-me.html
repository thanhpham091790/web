                            <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought
                                that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was
                                too
                                much. </p>
                            <p>
                                Things were terrible. I
                                had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
                                relationship.
                            </p>
                            <a class="about-me-link" href="#">
                                How I turned things
                                around
                            </a>
                            <p>
                                <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I
                                literally
                                put 90% of my
                                possessions in the
                                garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It wasn't easy at all, but everything
                                around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                            </p>

                                Now that I'm
                                living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                                more, and I have more free time
                                to enjoy.

                                With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start

                                    I did it</strong>, and how
                                others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
